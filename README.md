# Iteration one of group project ecse 223

This document would explain the design decisions of the classes and their role in the application
Also it will specify how to do some required usecases in the application


## Please Read This To work on the project
1. The main interface is a single page os size (1500, 800) and it is divided in half. Each half is occupied by a class called "SidePanel". The interactions would simply exchange those SidePanels and therefore, no new Frames are required.
2. To Create a new SidePanel Simply create a new Class that extends the SidePanel Class. See: MainSidePanel, DrawingPanel, ChangeTableLocationPanel.

Thank you,
Sincerely,

Group 05
